<a href = "https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> is a very popular web platform that hosts competitive programming contests. It also has a multitude of problems of varying difficulty levels for all types of programmers, be it a newbie or an expert. 

Often, users find it difficult to choose unsolved problems to solve for practice. We have built a website that **recommends 3 categories of problems** (**Easy**, **Medium** and **Hard**) to the user, **based on his/her codeforces rating**. The problems are randomly chosen, and are only those which are not solved by the user yet.

This repository includes all the codes which the website uses. The website can be accessed at http://cfprobrecom.byethost8.com.

## Demonstration
1. Open the <a href = "http://cfprobrecom.byethost8.com/">website</a>, and enter your codeforces user handle.

 2. Click the **Go** button, or press _Enter_. You will see the **user statistics**, **recommended problems** in all 3 categories, and a list of **recent contests** that the user has participated in on Codeforces.
